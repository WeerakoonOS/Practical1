<h2>Be my Eyes !</h2>
<p id="para1">often heard the sentence, <i>“If only I had a pair of eyes in my home, once or twice a day, I wouldn’t have to ask friends and family for help.”</i> The blind were referring to many ordinary, daily situations, when they needed a pair of eyes for a short but important moment and were forced to bother their friends, family or neighbors. Such situations were, for example, looking for a can of coconut oil, but being unsure which one of the three cans in the cupboard it is. Or being unable to tell whether the expiration date of a product has passed. Or simply wanting to check themselves out in the mirror before they left home.
<br><br>
<b>Be My Eyes</b> helps in exactly these kinds of situations.

<u>Visually Impaired People </u> or else in more colloquial words the <strike>blinds</strike>, can be considered as the one of most inactive people out of entire differently able community. Despite being well grown <sup>physically</sup>, they are not able to manage themselves just because of mere <sub>blindness</sub>. Losing the sight is more influential than any other disability because it turns to be hard to make one’s own decisions. Therefore eventually the blind person becomes a dependant of his family members, friends or anyone nearby because he finds it is difficult to manage his day by himself. Even at a time he needs so much to let things happen the way he likes, he does not get a chance!
<br><br></p></div><p>
To meet this requirement, we have come up with a practical solution with the aid of modern technology. Here, a series of real-time photos will be taken at a given time and then is done through Visual APIs. Then through the headset, the blind person wears, he is provided with the information about what is contained in the area captured. He can then easily choose on his own what is around him without bothering others around him, make the decisions and decide where to go and what to choose.
